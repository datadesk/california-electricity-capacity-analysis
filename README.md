This data analysis provided information for the February 5, 2017, Los Angeles Times story ["Californians are paying billions for power they don't need"](http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-fi-electricity-capacity/) by documenting California's glut of power and the increasing cost to consumers. It also underpins a [complementary interactive graphic](http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-fi-electricity-capacity-graphic/). The data are drawn from the Energy Information Administration, a branch of the United States government.

The [analysis.ipynb](analysis.ipynb) file outlines the collection, transformation and analysis of the data.
